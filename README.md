# 🔥 Animated Social Media Links with Dark Mode

This is a stylish and interactive single-page web application that displays animated social media links using Tailwind CSS, GSAP, and custom flame/ember effects. The design features a smooth dark/light theme toggle, animated icons, and visual "fire" effects when hovering over each icon — adding a dynamic and engaging visual layer to your social media contact section.

## 🧠 How It Works

Each social media icon is wrapped in a "burn effect" container that triggers visual and audio effects on hover. The application uses:

- CSS keyframes for flame, flicker, and ember animations.
- JavaScript to manage dark mode preferences and dynamically load social icons.
- GSAP for future animation expansion or advanced sequencing (included via CDN).
